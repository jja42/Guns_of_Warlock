Look, I'm not sure how you got here.
But, that's okay. You seem pretty inquisitive. That's a really good trait to have.
People that ask a lot of questions end up with a lot of answers.

The only way to get back is dying, I think. I don't know though, because I am a sign.
Signs don't know anything.

I am doomed to a placid existence which will outlast humanity and I must suffer in my wooden tomb of language.
I hope you have a good day, I think. Goodbye.
